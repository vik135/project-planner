# project-planner
## Description
Welcome to the ProjectFlow App! ProjectFlow is an efficient and appealing app that allows users to visualize and organize assignments.
Through a variety of special features such as a dynamic calendar, AI-based project planning, and progress visualization, users are able
to take charge of their their assignments in a timely manner.


To make our application available to you, please follow the following steps:

## Getting Started
Before you begin, please ensure you have downloaded the following on your machine: 
- [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Please ensure that you have downloaded the software compatible with your device. These are the only external downloads you must make to allow for backend setup.

## Installing Dependencies
After cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/vik135/project-planner`

Change your local working directory to the cloned repository:

`cd project-planner`

And to install all dependencies:

`npm install`

## Running App on Local Host

Once you have installed all the modules and project dependencies, you are ready to deploy the app! To view and use the app in your local host, change
your current working directory to project-planner (or root directory of the project), and run:

`npm start` 

**Note:** If you are not able to see the app in your browser, you can view it manually by searching: 

`https://localhost:3000`

## Notes
If you would like to visualize the database and view database entries, please install the MongoDB Compass as such: 
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

Once you open the Compass, you can connect to the local port by connecting to `mongodb://localhost:27017/` and navigating to the "test" directory.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
In version 1.0 of our app, please be mindful while using our AI Project Planner tool. Files larger than a certain page amount (over 5 pages) may not be parsed.
Please limit your use of this functionality to smaller assignment specs (2-4 pages) for maximum performance.
